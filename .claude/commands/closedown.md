Update DEVLOG.md with what was accomplished in this session.

**Your task:**
1. Review the conversation history to understand what was done this session
2. Read DEVLOG.md to see the current format and latest session number
3. Add a new session entry with:
   - Session number (increment from last)
   - Today's date
   - **What was changed?** (concise, bullet points)
   - **Why was it changed?** (concise explanation of the problem/goal)
   - **Tradeoffs** (if any - what was gained vs what was lost, or note "None")
   - **Next steps:** (what should be done next based on discussion)

Follow the existing DEVLOG.md format. Keep it concise - focus on decisions and tradeoffs, not implementation details.

After updating DEVLOG.md, show the user what you added.
